# RBAC-Backend-Service
This project implements two independent backend services using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript with role-based access control (RBAC). A shared MongoDB cluster supports secure data sharing. The User Backend manages user-specific operations, while the Admin Backend handles administrative tasks, ensuring secure cross-backend communication via JWT.
